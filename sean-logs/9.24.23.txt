Meeting with Chris to help debug test functions 6:00-7:35
- Helped get his testing working
  - Missing CMakeLists.txt includes in src, native, and lua for l_object and n_object
  - Missing object.lua mod inclusion in init.lua
- Helped describe what input parameters in a lua function is and how it is called
Lua:
param1.function(param2, param3)
C++:
param1 = checkobject(L, 1)
param2 = checkobject(L, 2)
param3 = checkobject(L, 3)
