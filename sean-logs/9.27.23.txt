Meeting with Erik 1:00pm - 1:30pm
- Discussed native implementation
- Found pathing error includes
- Added "../../" to include directories to enable header file functions to be referenced
- Still receiving error with incompatibilities
- Passing in an ObjectRef into nativeObjectRef doesn't work because ObjectRef class is not referenced in nativeObject  
- Have to create a constructor class to duplicate ObjectRef then pass that parameter into native

Meeting with Blanchard 1:30pm - 2:30pm
- Work on getting native functions working
- GitHub repo issues (Blanchard might work with me to address these issues)
- Keep creating tests and automated testing (input a param = 10 and run every command)
- Erik promoted to branch manager
- Erik is going to work with Alice
